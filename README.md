# LLM for Coding

Welcome to the LLM for Coding repository, where we harness the power of large language models (LLMs) to enhance coding experiences. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that interface with state-of-the-art code generation models.

## Notebooks

- `code_llama.ipynb`: Utilizes the **CodeLlama-13B-Instruct-fp16** model for generating code with a focus on following instructions closely.
- `code_with_gemma.ipynb`: Leverages the **codegemma-2b** model, optimized for generating high-quality code snippets.
- `code_llama-3.ipynb`: Employs the **llama-3** model, designed for versatile code generation across various programming languages.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
2. Clone this repository:
   ``` bash
   git clone git@github.com:imanoop7//llm_for_coding.git
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and start Jupyter:
   cd llm_for_coding
4.Open the desired notebook and follow the instructions within to start coding with the power of LLMs.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
Internet connection (for model access)
Models
Here’s a brief overview of the models used in our notebooks:

* CodeLlama-13B-Instruct-fp16: A 13-billion parameter model fine-tuned for following specific coding instructions.
* codegemma-2b: A 2-billion parameter model that excels in generating concise and accurate code.
* llama-3: A versatile model capable of understanding and generating code in multiple programming languages.
